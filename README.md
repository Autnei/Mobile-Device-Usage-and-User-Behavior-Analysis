# Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior-Analysis
This project analyzed mobile device usage and user behavior, focusing on screen time, data usage, and battery drain. The analysis revealed trends across demographics, operating systems, and device models.

The following insights were uncovered from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Devices like the iPhone 12 show a high average battery drain (1589.51 mAh/day), indicating that some models are more power-intensive.

IOS users have higher average data usage (965.51 MB/day) than Android users (920.32 MB/day).

A significant portion of users (79.14%) are on Android, with only 20.86% using iOS.

Despite having higher screen-on times, older users tend to use less data, possibly indicating engagement in non-data-intensive activities.

iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21, Xiaomi Mi 11, and OnePlus 9 are among the most used devices, each displaying unique user behavior patterns.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Implement battery optimization features, especially for high-drain models. This might include a battery-saving mode within the app or reminders to close background apps. This can improve user satisfaction for heavy users of these devices.

Introduce data-saving features, particularly for iOS users. Consider adding a "Low Data Mode" within the app or tips for managing data usage which could benefit iOS users in particular and enhance their user experience.

Prioritize Android when developing or optimizing app features, as it has a larger user base. Ensure regular updates are compatible with a wide range of Android models to improve accessibility and retention for Android users.

For older users, consider promoting offline features, as they might prefer using their devices without relying heavily on data. This could improve engagement by making the app more accessible to users with data constraints.

Optimize app performance and experience for these high-usage device models. Conduct testing and collect feedback specifically from users on these models to identify any device-specific issues and enhance user experience.
